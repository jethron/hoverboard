### Introduction

{$ title $} is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. {$ title $} takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.

### Policy

All participants of {$ title $} events must abide by the [Digital Analytics NSW Inc Code of Conduct]({$ codeOfConductBlock.form $}):

We understand that most people who come to Data & Analytics Wednesday and MeasureCamp are awesome. However, to ensure this is a welcoming place for everyone, we expect this event to be free from any form of discrimination or harassment.  We expect that you will avoid any inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics such as race, religion, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.

Harassing or disruptive behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to suggestive or intimidating behavior and language, unwelcome jokes or comments, unwanted touching or attention, offensive or aggressive physical behavior. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior is likewise prohibited. Should you behave like this, you will be asked to leave and face the possibility of being banned from future events subject to review by the organisers of this event.


### Why this policy is important

Harassment at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official policy aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not acceptable within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly defining expectations for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages people who have had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.
